 *    - place files in same directory as this file
 *    - tab spacing
 *    - empty line at end of file
 *    - Does not apply to rule blocks above this TODO block (if any).
 *    - If, after this is complete, this file is empty, delete it.
 *    - If, after this is complete, this file is NOT empty, then relocate it
